This MOD was originally called "invite winter" and could be found on modworkshops (possibly?). 
Its original function was to generate Winter Captions by pressing the binding key and aiming accurately at the location. 
I removed this restriction and made the file automatically summon Winter Captions every 4 minutes to the host's current location. 
This MOD has been effective in all robbery cases.
